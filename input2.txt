OK, everybody ready! Quiet on the set.
- Roll sound.- Rolling.
- Camera.- Rolling.
Action!
Action! Action!
- Can I start?- Get on with it!
No, I am not Byron, I am some other
Elect who yet remains unknown
A pilgrim, though with a Russian soul
Like him I am driven through the world in pother
I set out early, I'll pass away sooner
My mind will not achieve a lot
