Good evening. You're watchingThe World of People.
In 1996, in Chechnya,Sergeant Kostya Gromov
was decorated for bravery,but he didn't know about it.
Now he has got his medal.Here is Kostya Gromov
and his comrades-in-armsDanila Bagrov and Ilya Setevoi.
Dmitry Gromov,a famous Russian hockey player
now in the NHLis Kostya's twin brother.
- What were you honored for?- It was a covert operation...
Alexander DIACHENKO
When I came round,I saw the Big Guy...
- Who's the Big Guy?- It's Kostya.
So the Big Guy was draggingthe two of us with his left hand.
And he had a machine gunand a Kalashnikov in his right hand
Blood was streaming out of me,my hip was busted. I could see
the Kalashnikov bouncing around,bumping against Danila's head.
I thought he was luckyto have his helmet on.
Other guys didn't make it.Here's a photograph.
- We're at a rest point.- It's summer already.
Which one of you is the toughest?
Danila.
He was very smartand never feared anything.
Hi. Turn on Channel 6.
Check out the boywith the full lips.
I'll call you back later.
Ray TOLER
Now I am a security guardin a bank.
A major one.It's the Nikolaevsky Bank.
I like it there.The guys are all athletes.
I'm actually from Kiev.
After school I went to my Dad in Tulaand soon I was recruited
And Ilya here works onthe Red Square.
It's the former Lenin Museum.I catalogue their archives.
They still have index cards.I also work as a night guard there.
That's how I bumped into Danila.I went out one morning
and he was standing there,looking at the Mausoleum.
What do you want to be?
Well, I want to enteran institute.
- Which one?- A medical school. I want to heal people.
Really? That's symbolic...
Look!
Your brother's in Moscow.They show him on TV.
And you sit here drinking vodka,you pig.
You'd better help your mother.
I'm going to die soon.
You'll be fine, Ma.
You should go to your brotherin Moscow.
He'd help you out,you fool.
He's your brother, after all.Screw him...
BROTHER - 2
This message is for subscriber 712515.
Irina, please call me on7641232.
It's Danila. You showed methe way to Channel 6.
Regards from Demidov.I'll be waiting.
- Who's that?- Saltykova.
- Where did you get the number?- From Demidov.
Warrant officer, get ussome more cold beer.
Mitya was with the Kiev Falconsfor 2 years.
Then he was drafted by the NHL to playfor the Chicago Black Hawks. Cool!
Can you imagine? Your brother'sgoing to America to play hockey!
But the Kiev mobgot him.
They egged Chicago Ukrainianson Mitya.
They said: "We raised you,we gave you money,
now it's payback time. "Greedy bastards!
Mitya knows if you pay once,you pay forever.
So he found some localprotection... an American.
Katya, we are talking, OK?
The American got it right.He found some people
to represent Mitya's interestsin the NHL.
Lots of agents came with contractsto sign.
Mitya signed them all andthe Ukrainians left him alone.
Everything was OK.He was scoring his goals.
Not long ago the PittsburghPenguins bought him.
But all the money goes tothe account of this American.
And Mitya gets peanuts.
Mitya waited and waited untilhe realized he's been conned.
He goes back to the Ukrainiansbut it's too late.
This American is sort ofa new Al Capone.
He even talks to Mitya throughhis lawyer.
And Mitya is a star!
- How much does he owe Mitya?- 900 grand, US dollars.
What about filing a lawsuit?
He signed a contract! Mitya didn'tspeak English that time.
He thought the Americans arehonest unlike our lot.
- Guys we want some beer.- Later.
This American has come to Moscow.
Mitya called me last night.
So what shall we do?
I'll talk to my boss. He's meetingthe American tomorrow.
Can you talk to theAmerican yourself? You speak English...
They wouldn't let me.He's a new Al Capone.
What if he never gives it back?
I don't know...
I can't let my brother down!
We're twins, we have alwaysbeen together...
It's been a year since I saw himand I miss him so much.
And who is this Al Capone?
Come on. He was the biggestgangster in America!
It's for you.
Oh, hi!
Girls!
I just wanted to see you.
Demidov gave me your number.
No, he's not here.
Kotelnicheskaya?Yes, I know.
See you.
- Where's Kotelnicheskaya?- You said you knew.
Reveille! Like they sayin the army.
Like they said.
Hey, entrant, time to getready for your exams.
Can I make a phone call?
The boss has arrived.
Hi, Mr. Belkin, I'm Kostya,Gromov's son, from Tula.
Yes, I remember. What is it?Two years ago you helped my brother.
Now he plays hockey in America.
You asked your partnerMr. Mennis from Chicago,
to look after Mitya.
But he conned him and tookall his money...
Would you, please talk to him?
If he does not listen to you,I'll do it myself.
- What will you do?- I'll speak to him.
- To whom?- To Mr. Mennis. He's in Moscow.
OK, Kostya, I'll talk to him.
Irina, do you alwayswatch yourself on TV?
- Dontcha like it?- Why, it's okay.
But I like bands like Nautilusor DDT.
What are you doing here then?Get out. I am pressed for time.
Come on, don't get mad with me.
They don't listen to this kindof music there. It's fake.
- Where?- In the war.
What war? There's no war here.And the rules are different.
This is my kind of music
I really like you. And the music's gotnothing to do with it.
Boris, have you gota payphone token coin?
Kostya? How did it go?
We'll party in the Metropol.
My boss promised to talk to him.
Pick me up at 6.Over and out!
How is it going, officer on duty?
You haven't been with usfor a long time, Valentin.
Progress, Richard.Fax, e-mail, Internet.
But you came to Moscowto appreciate the beauty of our capital.
Kate, get us some mint tea please.
I came, Valentin,because your offer is very serious.
You're right. A federal law was passedallowing gambling in Indian reservations.
It's illegal for foreign companiesto buy land there.
That's why I addressed to you.I know you talent for evading the law.
- Mr. Belkin, the tea's ready.- Bring it, please.
We are talking aboutlarge sums of money.
Sums I know you don't have.
That's true.But I have very serious partners
whose names I can't tell even you.
The main thing is that everythingwill go through me.
Now I would like to knowyour ideas on technicalities.
He's busy at the moment,I'll tell him. Good bye.
It's very good.
Two years ago I asked you to helpa Russian hockey player in Chicago?
He had some difficultieswith the Ukrainian Mafia.
If you asked, Valentin,everything is all right.
We are getting involvedin a big operation.
You are interested in diamondsI am interested in the NHL.
It should not concernour new agreement.
We should be looking outfor each other.
I'll pick you upat the "Metropol" hotel at 6.
Take Mr. Mennis to the hotel.
Get me Chief of security!Quickly!
Still asleep? It's already5 o'clock!
You pick up Kostya,I'll come at 7.
- OK?- OK. Over and out.
Brake with your legs, not withyour head, shitass.
There are too many freaks. They buycars and driving licenses
but they can't actually drive.
Where are you going?
You asshole!
You should be driving a road-roller.Where do they get their money?
They probably buy it as well!
A country of sheep and goats!
You vote for a thin guy, andin a year you're watching
some arse-faced hog on TVwho tells you how to live.
- Where?- Turn right behind that building.
That's the Taganka Theater!Behind that building indeed.
There were fewer halfwitsin my generation.
Can't you tell red from green,you cow?
Green means 'go', red means 'stop'!
They used to be sensible people
and suddenly they all turnedinto cretins. Paradox.
Sound the horn.
That's not a boat...That'll be 66 rubles.
- Wait a minute, I'll get my friend.- Even women never wait for such morons.
Police.
It's a murder. 7 Khokhlovsky Lane,apartment 4.
It's Konstantin Gromov.
Found by Danila Bagrov.Waiting.
Ilya, Kostya's been killed.
Don't call on his cellular phone.Wait at the museum.
Chief, putthe beds down.
Gimme a cigarette.
Hey, blockhead, gimme a light.
You deaf, shithead?You hear what the guv said?
So, you were planning to enteran institute.
You came to check outthe access courses.
And you didn't knowabout the registration? Right?
Can't you read it?
I can hold you for anotherthree days.
Do you really want it?
- Why did you beat them up?- They asked for it. I want my Discman back.
Nikolaevsky Bank. Founders:Belkin Valentin Edgarovich.
Child: Belkin Fedya.Studies at Nikolaevsky School.
We need guns.
Hello, Fascist. It's Ilya.
We need trophies of war.
OK.
- Heil Hitler.- Hi.
- Who's he?- One of our own.
A brother to your own,for better or for worse. '
It's a popular fascist saying.
- I'm Fascist.- Danila.
- Are you German?- Russian.
- Actually my Granddad was killed in the war.- It happens.
What can I offer you, gentlemen?Five MPs -
four 40s, and a 38.
Everything is checked.With full ammunition.
Here are anti-personnelfragmentation grenades.
They sometimes misfire.It's a 50-50 chance.
Panzerfausts with two rounds.Sorry, not checked.
Here are the handguns: four Walthers,one Parabellum.
It's imported stuff.As for domestic products
there's a Degtyarev machine-gun.It was hardly ever used.
Four PPS's - they're heavy,but reliable.
There's one Tula Tokarev or TT.
They get snapped upvery quickly.
There's one Naganbut it's not very reliable.
The firing pin's worn down.
I don't suppose you'd beinterested in Mosin rifles.
Where does all this come from?
It's the echo of the war.
- Where are we going?- To Moscow.
Hey, Dan, he's still there.
Brother.
...then I went to the Nikolaevsky Bank
and asked for Kostya Gromov.Mum gave me the address.
Some jerk of a guard said:"No one of this name works here".
So, I thought if there's nobodyat the museum...
I've got no money and the cops checkmy passport on every corner.
Lucky I've got my policepants on.
Wow! Is it real?
It belonged to Chapayev.
- Those were the days!- Will you go to America with me?
Anywhere you say.
We need passports and visas,
and a good car for a few hours.
Brother, will you help me?
Give me a light.
You ever get any sleep?
My boss is always on the movedoing things.
He's got a cool car.Is it German?
- Whom do you want to see?- Fedya Belkin.
- He's already arrived.- I'm his brother. I'm late.
That's OK, they haven't started yet.
- You can leave it here.- I've got a present there.
This concert is dedicated tothe Students' Day.
Meet Fedya Belkin.
He will recite the Student'spoem!
I discovered that I've gotRelatives, and they're my lot.
They are woods that are so dearFields of corn and every ear,

Goodbye, America,
Where I have never been,
Farewell forever...

I pull on the trigger,your balls fall down.
Frightened? Were you frightenedwhen you killed Kostya?
Kostya?
Yes, Gromov.
It wasn't me. It wasthe American.
It was him. I couldn't.I know his father.
I promised Kostya. I didn't thinkhe'd refuse. He's greedy.
Tell me everything aboutthe American. Now!
Sorry, I'm talkingwith a sponsor.
A few more minutes
Still talking?
He's a big shot in lllinois.
He financed the mayor'selection campaign.
He's got congressmen in his pocket.He deals in drugs,
owns a string of blues androck clubs in Chicago.
He launders his moneyin them.
His headquarters arein the Metro club.
He deals in land andreal estate.
He does any business promisingmoney, like NHL...
He orders films in Russiawith real rapes and murders
and sells them over there.He's very greedy.
He'll kill you for 100 bucks.And he conned Kostya's brother.
I... I didn't do it.
A million is no big deal for him.He's got...
Don't shoot. You'rea reasonable man.
All right, live on, scum.Thank your son.
It'd be a shame to leave sucha nice kid without a father.
Sit quiet and letyour pants dry out.
Don't bother him. He's writingan application for the school board.
You should see a doctor.Prostatitis is a mean thing.
You won't get a hard onand that's all.
Give me a break!
Why did you kill him, you oaf?!
You told me yourself:
he doesn't mind his own businessand you don't want to see him around.
Shitass!
And Ilya, he works onthe Red Square.
It's the former Lenin Museum.I catalogue their archives.
I also work as a night guard there.
- That's how I bumped into Danila.- To the museum, fast!
Got to get a new car.There's too much heat.
- I changed the plates.- That thug at the school memorized them.
- I'll change them again.- When will passports be ready?
Tomorrow or the day after.It's not easy.
Yes... He's dead.
Here's the money. Nothing more left.
As soon as you get the passportsbuy two tickets to Chicago.

The old guy doesn't remembera fucking thing.
Lay an ambush. Start looking fora white Volvo.
Call the traffic police.They could change registration plates.
Check out the airlines:The name is Bagrov, flying to Chicago.

Maybe you should becomea music producer?
Maybe I will. But I've gotno ear for it.
Another four hours.I thought we'd finish sooner,

Tired?
I'm not alone. My brotherVictor's here.
He was like a father to me.

Do you know this poem?
I discovered that I've gotRelatives, and they're my lot.
Fuck you, snowflake.
They are woods that are so dearFields of corn and every ear
I'll cut your ass.
Streams of water, skies of blueI will tell them: "I love you".
You white shithead! I'll blow your head off!
It's the Homeland of mine.
I will love it all the time.
Marilyn. Come here, you bitch!
Is there a back wayout of here?
Hi! What are you doing?
I'm running!
Mr. Belkin, we've transferredthe money.
We're up and running,as they say.
Your reputation and your wordspeak for themselves.
But you've got problems.
Like I said, I sort it out -
You don't take chanceswith this kind of money.
What does 'how are you' mean?
It means 'how are you'.
- Do they really mean it?- No, they do not.
- Then why do they ask?- They just ask.
But they are dead seriouswhen it comes to money.
I'm hungry.
Look, crawfish climb outright onto the pier
and no one bothersto catch them.
- Maybe he isn't coming?- He'll come.
Brother...
Eight years is a long time.
I wasn't even twenty then.
University, Perestroika,America, Coca-Cola.
Got married, then got divorced.
I worked for an escortservice in New York. I was a call girl.
Then coke, crack.
I went to Chicago with onefattie. He dumped me.
Then I got mixed up withthat black jerk.
Oh, one shouldn't speakill of the dead.
Anyway, it's all boringand dull.
You know it was 1984when I last sat at the campfire.
We went camping atGlukhoe Lake...
Come home with us.It's OK there.
- And what will I do there?- What are you doing here?
I like it here. America is the world'sdriving power!
- What is its power, brother?- It's the money, brother.
Money rules the world. Whoeverhas the most is the strongest.
Suppose, you've got a lot of money.What would you do?
- I'd buy everyone.- Even me?
What does he want?Some crawfish?
What do you want?
Dirt. He says the food's dirty.
Crawfish eat the dirt.We shouldn't eat them.
What? Dirt?
Look at you Black scum.
You need a good scrub! Get lost!
Leave him. Negro, go, go!
Who are you calling Negro?I'll show you a real Negro.
- You shouldn't call him a Negro.- And who is he?
- He's an Afro-American.- What's the difference?
Nigger sounds offensive to them.
That's what I was taught atschool. The Chinese live in China,
the Germans live in Germany, the Jewsin Israel & Negroes in Africa.
I think the power's in them.There's something primordial
& brutal about these people. We lost it,that's why they're stronger.
The whites know it and they'reafraid of them.
- We'd better go.- Bastards, they spoiled the party.
What are you doing here?- A toilet.
Back there.
Richard.

Can I talk to Mr. Mennis?
No, thank you.
He's at the Metro ClubHe'll be back late at night.

Don't shoot.
Where's Mennis?
Money.
Where's Mennis?
In Mennis's office.
It's all in cash there.
I discovered that I've gotRelatives and they're my lot.
They are woods that are so dearFields of corn and every ear.
Streams of water, skies of blue.I shall tell them: "I love you!"
It's the Homeland of mine.
...and they're my lot.
They are woods that are so dearFields of corn and every ear.
Streams of water, skies of blue.I shall tell them: "I love you!"
It's the Homeland of mine.I will love it all the time.
I discovered that I've gotRelatives and they're my lot.
They are woods that are so dearFields of corn and every ear.
- How are you?- Thank you. I'm OK.
That's great.
Ah, Russian vodka! Good.
Come on.
American, what's your power?Is it really money?
My brother says it's money.
You've got lots of money -so what?
Truth is a real power.Whoever is right is strong.
You cheated on a manand took away his money.
Did it make you stronger?
No, it did not.
Cos you are not right.
And the person you cheated on is.
That means he's stronger.
Right?
Right.
Dmitry Gromov, gimme his money.
So, play hockey.
Will my money keep on goingto Mennis' account?
Tell them to make transfersto your account.
- What about the contract?- Forget it.

You are like your brother...
